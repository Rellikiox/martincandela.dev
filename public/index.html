            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a developer by trade, it's what I do best. My primary focus has been on backend
                technologies, but I have also gained experience in frontend development through personal projects, and
                I'm always eager to learn new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have spent the last 8 years working on Google's Digital Garage, an e-learning platform with over 10M
                users. From its conception and the development of the first prototype, to its launch on a single market,
                its expansion to over 50 markets, and finally shutting it down after migrating its content and users to
                a new home in the Google ecosystem. Now that this project is being sunset I'm looking for a new project
                that offers the opportunity to further develop and utilize my skills, while collaborating with talented
                professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't stand it when websites make me wait, so I always make it a point to optimize the sites I work on
                to be as efficient as possible. That means they run faster, are cheaper to operate, and the users are
                happier. Another thing I love is tackling technical debt. I enjoy diving into a system, figuring out
                what it really needs to do, and getting rid of anything that doesn't contribute to that goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not working or juggling parent duties I like to wind down cooking, creating small videogames
                (and playing them) and reading.
