            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm an engineer through and through, I love cracking problems and finding efficient solutions, it's what
                I do best. It began during primary school, where I would sneak away to the computer lab between classes,
                and it became real when I got a Master's in Computer Science.
                My primary focus has been on backend technologies, but I also have experience in frontend development
                through personal projects, and I'm always eager to learn new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have spent the last 8 years working on Google's Digital Garage, an e-learning platform with over 10M
                users. From its conception and the development of the first prototype, to its launch on a single market,
                its expansion to over 50 markets, and finally shutting it down after migrating its content and users to
                a new home in the Google ecosystem. During my time working on this project I went from a developer, to
                the principal developer, to the tech lead of the whole program. Now that this project is being sunset
                I'm looking for a new project that offers the opportunity to further develop and utilize my skills,
                while collaborating with talented professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my carrer I've always made an effort to make systems as efficient as possible. I can't stand
                it when websites make me wait, so I always make it a point to optimize every project I work on from its
                inception. That means they run faster, are cheaper to operate, and the users are
                happier. I also love is tackling technical debt. I enjoy diving into a system, figuring out
                what it really needs to do, and getting rid of anything that doesn't contribute to that goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not working or juggling parent duties I like to wind down cooking, creating small videogames,
                playing them, and reading.

                I've also worked on many projects beyond work, which allowed me to break out of the
